Sumabay pa umano dito ang pagtaas ng kaso ng COVID-19 sa QC, gayundin din ang pagdoble ng kasong namomonitor sa kanilang mga constituent na nakatira sa labas ng campus. \u201cKaya naisipan ng aming UP Diliman COVID Task Force na pansamantalang isara muli ang aming public spaces\u2014ang aming academic oval, ang aming bike routes\u2014dahil hindi napipigilan ang mga tao pag pumupunta sila rito kahit marami pang signages at may nagbabantay para sabihin mag distancing, magsuot ng mask.\" \"Marami kaming nakikitang hindi ginagawa ito lalo na sa harap ng mga ilang kainan o kaya pag sila ay napapagod mag-bike sila ay nagkukumpulan, ibinababa ang kanilang mask, parang hirap na kaming i-control ito kahit pa humingi kami ng tulong sa barangay,\u201d sabi ni Bawagan.

May mga natikitan na rin umano na mga lumalabag sa health protocols.\u00a0 Hindi lamang umano mga residente ng lungsod ang dumadayo sa UP Diliman at marami ay mula sa karatig na mga lungsod at lalawigan. \u201cSiguro dahil nga kulang ng parke ang ibang mga siyudad at maganda pa ang hangin sa UP campus kaya sila bumibisita,\u201d sabi niya Dagdag ni Bawagan na ang hakbang ng UP Diliman ay bilang kontribusyon nila para mabawasan ang pagkalat ng COVID-19. Ang mga residente naman ng campus ay pinahihintulutang mag-ehersisyo sa kani-kanilang lugar lamang at hinihikayat ang pagsunod sa health protocol tulad ng pagsusuot ng face mask, face shield at physical distancing."

        "author": "ABS-CBN News",
        "content": "MANILA - The Integrated Bar of the Philippines on Friday slammed an alleged Philippine National Police (PNP) request from a court a for list of lawyers representing members of supposed \"communist-terrorist\" groups in the country. The Supreme Court earlier said Calbayog Regional Trial Court received the request signed by a certain Police Lt. Fernando Calabria Jr. from the Calbayog City Police Station, but \"no action\" has been done by the said court so far. \"The letter disregards the very basic principle that lawyers are free and even duty-bound to represent those accused regardless of political or ideological persuasions so that their rights are protected, due process is observed, justice is done, and that the rule of law is upheld. Lawyers therefore should not be suspected, discriminated against, faulted, red-tagged, or attacked for doing their professional duty,\" IBP national president Domingo Egon Cayosa said in a statement. \"The letter is improper, deplorable, and alarming.\" Cayosa called on authorities for a comprehensive probe on the request and \"promote state responsibility to ensure that lawyers can do their job without threats, harassment, intimidation, or retribution.\" \"As we remain vigilant, we trust that Filipino lawyers will remain courageous and steadfast sentinels of the rule of law,\" he said. The National Union of People's Lawyers (NUPL) also condemned the request. The NULP said the letter shows \"barefaced disregard of the PNP for human rights, particularly the right to access lawyers and legal services.\u00a0 \"It is an affront to the right and duty of lawyers to exercise their profession without fear as well as the administration of justice,\" the NUPL said in a statement. \"The police has no right to profile lawyers on the basis of their clients' personalities or ideologies. Under the UN Basic Principles on the Role of Lawyers, lawyers must 'not be identified with their clients or their clients' causes as a result of discharging their functions.' Nevertheless, lawyers, like other citizens, are entitled to freedom of expression, belief, association and assembly. The persecution of lawyers, on account of their functions as officers of the court, simply cannot be tolerated,\" it said. The union accused the PNP as the \"leading perpetrators of lawlessness and terror\" in the Philippines under the \"murderous regime\" of President Rodrigo Duterte, who came to power in 2016 on a promise to eradicate crime and illegal drug trade through violent means. \"It was the police that mercilessly killed suspected drug offenders in the tens of thousands and, most recently, nine activists in Southern Tagalog -- tokhang-style -- while allegedly enforcing search warrants for loose firearms. Even the reported assassins of Calbayog City Mayor Ronald Aquino are uniformed police personnel,\" the NUPL said.\u00a0 The police request came days after Aquino and several others were killed. Authorities claimed it was a shootout between the mayor's men and the police, but a lawmaker, along with Aquino's son, argued it was an ambush by non-uniformed cops. \"The letter intensifies the atmosphere of fear and repression with which lawyers are trying to perform their sworn duties towards the courts, society, and their clients, regardless of the latter's political beliefs. It has no objective other than to create a virtual hitlist of lawyer targets to be 'neutralized.' Needless to state, it must be rebuffed, even condemned, by the courts,\" the NUPL said. At least 54 lawyers, judges and prosecutors have been killed during the term of Duterte, the union said, and the PNP's request to get the names of lawyers of CTG members' \"produces a chilling effect\" to legal counsels in the Philippines. \"We thus reiterate our calls for measures that will ensure that lawyers such as ourselves will be able to perform all of our professional functions without intimidation, hindrance, harassment or improper interference. We also demand that the PNP immediately desist from harassing our colleagues in the legal profession -- lawyers for \"CTG personalities\" or not,\" the NUPL said. According to Cayosa, the IBP was assured by top PNP officials that there was no directive to Calabria to procure the names of legal counsels. FROM THE ARCHIVES"

        "author": "Angela Coloma, ABS-CBN News",
        "content": "MANILA (UPDATE) - Traces of drugs were found in the Makati hotel room where Christine Dacera and her friends stayed before her death on New Year\u2019s Day, results of the National Bureau of Investigation probe showed.\u00a0 This was among the evidence the NBI used as basis to file several criminal charges, including drug-related complaints, obstruction of justice, perjury and reckless imprudence resulting in homicide against 11 people, including Dacera\u2019s companions at the time.\u00a0 Mark Anthony Rosales and Rommel Galido were charged for illegal drug use, as they allegedly tried to deliver or give away drugs at the party, on top of the obstruction of justice charges filed by the NBI against them and their other companions.\u00a0 Apart from Rosales and Galido, John Dela Serna, Gregorio De Guzman, Jezreel Rapinan, Alain Chen, Reymay Englis, and Darwin Macalla are also facing obstruction of justice charges.\u00a0 The parallel investigation requested by Dacera\u2019s family found that there was drug use at Room 2209 of the City Garden Grand Hotel, where Dacera and her friends stayed, based on statements by witnesses who were at the scene of the incident.\u00a0 Crime scene investigation found traces of fluoromethamphetamine and methamphetamine, both stimulant drugs, in vomit near the toilet bowl where Dacera had puked in the wee hours of January 1.\u00a0 \"One of the matters taken by SOCO (Scene of the Crime Operatives) at vomitous matter at around 6:39, makikita mo si Tin sa harap ng toilet bowl by the occupants of room 2209 so 'yung portion na 'yon, 'yung vomitous matter na 'yun was taken in the forensic [examination]. That vomitous matter has presence of 4 flouromethamphetamine and methamphetamine so dalawa ang nakitang illegal drugs,\" Zylykha Marie Corales Deramo of the NBI said in a press conference.\u00a0 (You can see Tin in front of a toilet bowl and helped by the occupants of Room 2209, so that portion, that vomitous matter was taken in the forensic [examination]. That vomitous matter has presence of 4 flouromethamphetamine and methamphetamine so two types of illegal drugs were found.) Deramo also added that Dacera herself allegedly stayed at room 2207, the neighboring room, not wanting to be at room 2209 because there was an \u201corgy\u201d happening in the room and that they were high on drugs.\u00a0 \"When she (Tin) went to room 2207 she alleged na ayaw na niya doon kasi number one nag-o-orgy ang mga ito and number 2, shuas. When we asked the occupants of room 2207 kung ano ang shuas, apparently it\u2019s gay lingo for 'high',\u201d Deramo said.\u00a0 (When she went to Room 2207, she alleged that she does not want to be in [2209] because number 1, they were having an orgy and number 2, shuas. When we asked the occupants of room 2207 what shuas was, apparently it's gay lingo for 'high'.)\u00a0 A witness who spent the night at Room 2207 also said Rosales offered him drugs.\u00a0 \"One of the occupants of room 2207 ay nakapagsabi na pumasok siya sa room 2209, common friend niya si Rommel, nagsabi 'baks may party drugs kami, bet mo?' Sabi niya ayoko. Apparently, hindi siya user pero nagpumilit itong si Rommel, went to a friend and asked for such party drugs. Sinabi niya na 'sorry baks ubos na pala,' so no more, so that\u2019s corroboration,\" Deramo said.\u00a0 (One of the occupants of room 2207 said when he entered room 2209, Rommel said \"we have party drugs, want some?\" He said no. Apparently he's not a user but allegedly, Rommel insisted, went to a friend and asked for such party drugs. But then said \"sorry there's no more,\" so no more, so that's corroboration.) There was also \"insinuation\" that Dacera herself took drugs, she added, but the NBI did not categorically say she did. \"JP Dela Serna and Rommel Galido also insinuated na Tin also used, na gumamit, ang sabi niya 'Mali kasi 'yon ang ecstasy at alcohol kasi 'yung heartbeat' but did not mention who took what ecstasy,\" she said, adding that Dacera had allegedly disclosed to Garrido that her drink was spiked by Mark Rosales. (JP Dela Serna and Rommel Galido also insinuated that Tin also used, he said \"it's wrong, ecstasy and alcohol affects the heartbeat' but did not mention who took what ecstasy.) Findings by the NBI contradict statements by Dacera\u2019s companions that there was no drug use at the party.\u00a0 However, the \"interplay between drugs and alcohol\" at the incident, according to Deramo, was still \"not very clear.\" The reautopsy of Dacera\u2019s body showed that her cause of death was \u201cmicroscopic evidence of peri-aortic hemorrhages and aortic wall distruption.\u201d\u00a0 The toxicology report also showed that Dacera\u2019s body had traces of Diltiazem, a prescription drug for hypertension. Asked when illegal drugs may have caused her death, the NBI said it was \u201cmedically probable\u201d for drugs to have started the aortic rupture on her body, based on scientific evidence they have gathered.\u00a0 \"We\u2019re not saying Christine Dacera took Diltiazem that night. We\u2019re saying na she had been taking Diltiazem which has been found sa presence ng liver and then 'yung sa stomach. This is to help her condition,\" NBI Spokesperson Ferdinand Lavin said in the press conference.\u00a0 \"On the night when she took illegal drugs and alcohol, it defeated the purpose of which she was taking the Diltiazem. Natalo 'yung kaniyang Diltiazem because she knew na mayroon siyang condition (Her Diltiazem was overpowered because she knew that she had the condition),\u201d NBI Spokesperson Ferdinand Lavin said in the press conference.\u00a0 The NBI, meanwhile, said they cannot prove rape allegations, as there were no fresh abrasions found on her labia at the time, at par with evidence presented by the PNP. Police had initially suspected the case was one of rape with homicide.\u00a0 Dacera, 23 was found unconscious and without a pulse in a bathtub at the Makati hotel around 12:30 p.m. on January 1 after a night of partying. Her friends said they tried to revive her and brought her to the Makati Medical Center, where she was later declared dead. Dacera and her friends had booked Room 2209 at City Garden Grand Hotel in Makati City to ring in the New Year. According to CCTV footage, they went back and forth to Room 2207 after being introduced to guests there.\u00a0 The PNP, in a medico-legal report, said Dacera died of natural causes, ruling out that her death on New Year\u2019s day was a crime after initially suspecting rape and homicide against her companions.

        "content": "MANILA - Sen. Panfilo Lacson on Friday said he is hoping the Department of Health would speed up its ongoing COVID-19 vaccination program, otherwise, the government\u2019s target to inoculate 60-70 percent of its overall population will only be finished by year 2033.\r\n\u00a0\r\nLacson based his statement on the DOH's recent vaccination statistics update where it reported a total of 114,615 individuals as of March 10. \"If we do not improve on this pace, and let\u2019s all hope we will accelerate, we will finish vaccinating the 70 percent targeted population to achieve herd immunity in 11 years and 8 months or 2033,\" he said in a statement. The Philippines can only have a faster inoculation program if the country can secure enough supply of vaccine and have it delivered on time, the senator said.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\"Let\u2019s hope na walang gaps ang deliveries para walang hinto, instead \u2013 tuloy tuloy ang pagbabakuna,\" he said. Health Secretary Francisco Duque III earlier said the pace of the country\u2019s COVID-19 vaccination program is \"not as quick\" as the government hoped for. \"The first week, I will admit, the vaccination rate was not as quick as we wanted it, but for obvious reasons. Siyempre nag-uumpisa pa lang (we have just started),\" he explained. Several health workers earlier refused to be inoculated with Chinese-made COVID-19 vaccines due to fears over possible side effects. The arrival of AstraZeneca vaccines would hopefully increase the number of Filipinos vaccinated against COVID-19, Duque said. \"Kung ayaw sa Sinovac, binigyan po natin sila ng right of first refusal, at \u2018yung AstraZeneca ibinigay para doon sa mga tumanggi,\" he said.\u00a0 (Secondly, there is this option for health workers to choose their vaccines.

Zulikha Conales Degamo, may nakitang bakas ng metamphetamine o fluoromethampethamine, o party drugs nang suriin ang bakas ng lugar kung saan sumuka si Dacera, 23, bago siya namatay.\u00a0 Pinagbasehan din ng NBI ang mga naging salaysay ng mga nakasama nina Dacera sa katabing kuwarto na nakasama pa nina Dacera na mag-party sa City Garden Hotel sa Makati.\u00a0 Nadiskubre rin na dati nang uminom ng maintenance drugs si Dacera para sa kondisyon niya sa puso.\u00a0 Bagama\u2019t aneurysm ang naging cause of death, ayon sa mga eksperto ng NBI, posibleng nagpalala sa kaniyang kondisyon ang paggamit ng ilegal na droga.\u00a0 \"According to our experts na kapag ikaw ay gumamit ng drugs ay tataas ang iyong BP (blood pressure). So magra-rapid ang iyong heartbeat at tataas ang iyong BP, which will ultimately result [in] the rupture of the aneurysm,\" ani Degamo, bagama't hindi tahasang sinabi ng NBI na gumamit ng droga si Dacera.\u00a0 Disyembre 31 nang mag-book ng hotel room sa City Garden Hotel si Dacera kasama ang kaniyang mga kaibigan para salubungin ang Bagong Taon. Sa Room 2209 ginawa ng magkakaibgan ang pagsalubong, at may mga nakasama rin umano silang mag-party sa katabing kuwarto na Room 2207.\u00a0 Pagsapit ng madaling araw ay nakaramdam ng pananakit ng ulo si Dacera at kalauna'y nawalan ng malay.

Dahilan ito para magsampa rin ang tanggapan ng obstruction of justice laban sa 8 kaibigan ni Dacera na kasama nito sa kuwarto.\u00a0 Kasama sa mga sinampahan ng kasong obstruction of justice sina: Mark Rosales, Rommel Galido, John Dela Serna, Gregorio De Guzman, Jezreel Rapinan, Alain Chen, Reymay English, at Darwin Macalla.\u00a0 Kinasuhan naman si Rosales at Garrido dahil sa pamimigay ng droga. May hiwalay namang kaso si Rosales dahil sa paggamit ng droga.\u00a0 Pinakakasuhan naman ang apat sa mga kaibigan ni Dacera ng reckless imprudence dahil ilang oras na ang lumipas bago nila ito binigyan ng first aid.\u00a0 \"Dahil sa kakaunting panahon na kasama ni Tin ang occupants ng Room 2207 ay nakita nila na humihingal at nahihirapan itong huminga, nagsabi pa siyang numb ang kaniyang katawan, masakit ang kaniyang ulo.

        "content": "MANILA - Marikina City Mayor Marcelino Teodoro on Friday expressed disappointment with the slow rollout of COVID-19 vaccines a year into the pandemic. \"The problem really is with the supply of the vaccine and the [national] government should, I think, it's imperative to address this problem of supply,\" he told ANC. Teodoro was reacting to the statement of Health Secretary Francisco Duque III that the inoculation drive was not quick enough. Over 114,000 people have so far received the shots more than a week after the country launched its vaccination program. Of those inoculated, 83,000 are health-care workers. In Marikina City, Teodoro said they had listed nearly 5,000 medical frontliners for the vaccination. \"We're only able to inoculate around 1,500. So, that's not even half of the number of medical frontliners that we intended to be inoculated,\" he said. On Feb. 28, the Philippines received its first batch of COVID-19 vaccine from China's Sinovac Biotech, with 600,000 doses. Through the vaccine-sharing COVAX facility, some 526,000 vaccines from AstraZeneca arrived few days later. Faced with surging coronavirus infections, the country aims to vaccinate up to 70 million of its 108 million people this year to achieve herd immunity and reopen the economy. Vaccine czar Secretary Carlito Galvez Jr. had said the Philippines is acquiring 161 million doses of coronavirus vaccine by year-end."

        "author": "Katrina Domingo, ABS-CBN News",
        "content": "MANILA - PDP-Laban president Sen. Manny Pacquiao on Friday said a supposed party resolution urging President Rodrigo Duterte to run as vice president in the 2022 national elections is illegitimate. PDP-Laban has yet to finalize its line-up for the 2022 national elections, Pacquiao said in a press conference. \"Hindi legitimate 'yung resolution na ginawa. Nalaman ko lang 'yun dahil sinabi sa'kin ng tao ko,\" he said. (The resolution is illegitimate. I only knew about it because one of my staff told me.) \"Hindi ko alam 'yun. Hindi 'yun sanctioned as acting president ng partido,\" he said. (I did not know about it. It was not sanctioned [by me] as acting party president.) The said resolution, dated March 8, was signed mostly by mayors and lawmakers, Melvin Matibag, PDP-Laban deputy party secretary general, earlier told ABS-CBN News. Among the signatories were MMDA chairman Benhur Abalos, Mandaluyong Mayor Carmelita Abalos, Quezon City Rep. Alfred Vargas, and Para\u00f1aque City Mayor Edwin Olivares. Sen. Aquilino Pimentel III said differences among party members on whether or not Duterte should run as vice president should not be considered as infighting. \"'Wag ninyo i-characterize as infighting,\" Pimentel said. (Do not characterize it as infighting.) \"Sen. Manny Pacquiao is reminding the members to focus sa pagtulong. Darating 'yung time para sa pulitika. Hintayin natin 'yung time para sa pulitika,\" he said. (Sen. Manny Pacquiao is reminding the members to focus on helping. The time for politics will come. Let's wait for that time to come.) Pacquiao on Friday issued a \"warning\" against Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi, the party vice-chair, who he said was sowing division within the group.\u00a0 The senator made the statement as he asked members to refrain from talking about the upcoming elections as the country continued to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 Cusi was allegedly among PDP-Laban members behind the resolution urging Duterte to run for vice president. On the same day the resolution was released, Duterte himself talked politics, saying his long-time ally Sen. Christopher \"Bong\" Go was aspiring to become president. Go denied this in a statement but said he might change his mind if the current chief executive would agree to run for vice president. DISCIPLINARY ACTION Pacquiao belied allegations that several party members were planning to break away from the ruling party, saying more politicians want to join PDP-Laban. \"Marami pang gusto mag oath, sumama sa partido. Sabi ko 'wag muna dahil pandemic pa, bawal pa,\" he said. (Many want to take their oath, join the party. I said not yet because the pandemic is still going.) When asked about conflicting statements being released by several PDP-Laban members, Pacquiao said: \"Inaayos na natin 'yung mga lumalabas na isyu.\" (We are already fixing the issues.) \"Aaksyunan namin 'yang mga ganiyan na hindi sumusunod sa partido,\" said Pacquiao, who boxing promoter Bob Arum last year said might also seek the presidency. (We will act on those who refuse to toe the party line.) Instead of disclosing specific sanctions against erring members, Pacquiao released a memo calling for unity within the party and directing all PDP-Laban members to avoid discussing politics at this time as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. \"I have the responsibility to enforce rules, promote cooperation, insist on civility and respect, and most of all, to remind you that we are one team,\" his memo read. \"Before we can truly solve the problems of the country, we must first focus on ourselves and our beloved party.\" This is not the first time PDP-Laban seemed divided months before an election. In 2018, a group from Mindanao claiming to be party members on Wednesday held an event at the Quezon Memorial Circle criticizing then PDP-Laban Secretary General Pantaleon Alvarez. The group, led by PDP-Laban national council chair Rogelio Garcia, slammed Alvarez for leading the mass-oath taking of new party members without complying with the application process.\u00a0 Old party members were not invited to PDP-Laban's 36th anniversary celebration at a hotel in Makati City, Garcia added. The group issued a resolution declaring Alvarez persona non grata from the party, but then-party president Pimentel denied that PDP-Laban had made such a declaration. In 2019, Alvarez accused the ruling party of keeping him in the dark about its decision to back Marinduque Rep. Lord Allan Velasco's bid for the House Speakership, which he was also vying for. Alvarez was hoping to make a comeback as Speaker after he was ousted from the post in 2018 in a coup maneuvered by the President's daughter, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte. Then Pampanga Rep. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was installed in his place. RELATED VIDEO"

        "author": "Trishia Billones, ABS-CBN News",
        "content": "MANILA (UPDATE) - Private hospitals could reach full capacity within 3 to 4 weeks if the upward trend of COVID-19 cases continues, the president of the Private Hospitals Association of the Philippines said Friday. \"If we don\u2019t do anything about it, most probably it will follow the trend, maybe in the next 3-4 weeks, if this is not abated, then we will be reaching the full capacity in the next 4 weeks,\" PHAP president Dr. Jose Rene De Grano told ANC's Headstart. Asked if he believes healthcare workers would have to call a timeout again soon, he said: \"Hopefully not, but that can happen. With strict health protocols, we\u2019ll be able to avoid that.\" Curfews and localized lockdowns imposed in several areas in the country, including Metro Manila, would be helpful in a sense that it would \"restrict movement for unnecessary things,\" he said. In August last year, President Rodrigo Duterte placed Metro Manila, Cavite, Laguna, Rizal and Bulacan back under modified enhanced community quarantine--the second strictest level of restriction--following a plea for \"timeout\" from health care workers as the number of COVID-19 cases ballooned to about 100,000. The Philippines has been logging around 3,000 new cases daily for the past week, with Thursday's addition being the highest in a day since September last year.\u00a0 The total number of coronavirus infections in the country stood at 607,048, according to the Department of Health. The number of active COVID-19 cases is 47,769, which is the highest since October 24 last year, according to monitoring by ABS-CBN Data Analytics Team.\u00a0 De Grano said private hospitals \"can actually still sustain it,\" but they need help from the government \"right now\" to solve at least 3 problems: funding, staffing, and vaccination. He said the income of hospitals \"went down\" at the start of the pandemic and \"resources were down to at least minimum.\" He said currently, state insurer PhilHealth owes hospitals around P6 billion.\u00a0 In its Circular 2020-0009, the agency has set benefit packages for in-patient care for probable or confirmed COVID-19 cases that develop mild to critical pneumonia, depending on the severity. \"We are asking government to please help us, please speed up the payment of PhilHealth,\" said De Grano. Manpower is another problem, he said, because \"a lot of nurses are resigning because they want to go overseas and some are transferring to government facilities.\"\u00a0 \"At least 50 percent of our nursing employees are out. I don\u2019t know where the Department of Labor got their figure that we have 400,000 ready-to-work nurses. No, most of the private hospitals have decreased the staffing of the nurses by 50 percent and that is the hard truth,\" he said. With a lean workforce, De Grano said hospitals are limiting the number of beds they can open to COVID-19 patients, and may not allot the usual 20 percent. Vaccine deployment is also an issue, as some members of the group have reported that they haven't received the allocation for their health care staff. He said there were cases wherein other hospitals that weren't COVID-19 referral centers got the jabs first. \"In my own hospital, we are still waiting for the deployment of our own vaccine. If we are going to be a vaccination center, we have to have our health care workers vaccinated first, and right now we haven\u2019t received our allotment,\" he said. De Grano said the early arrival of coronavirus shots would have \"helped a lot\" because while these do not prevent transmission, it could \"more or less minimize the fatalities.\" The Philippines started rolling out vaccines last week, with about 1.1 million combined doses from Sinovac and AstraZeneca. Government officials have stated that they aim to inoculate most health care workers within March. RELATED VIDEO"

Ayon sa mga nakakita, kinaladkad umano palabas ng bahay ang misis at mga anak ni Dela Cruz bago sila nakarinig ng magkasunod na putok ng baril bago mag-alas-4 ng madaling araw. \"Wala po kami magawa, ano po, nakabantay po sa amin 'yung mga pulis po,\" ani alyas \"Alice,\" kaanak ni Dela Cruz.

This developed, as Metro Manila mayors agreed to reimpose a curfew for two weeks starting Monday, and the OCTA Research group sounded the alarm on the spike of infections in the capital region in recent weeks.\u00a0\u00a0 The day's fresh cases are the highest since last September 14, when the Department of Health (DOH) announced 4,699 confirmed infections, the ABS-CBN Investigative and Research Group said.\u00a0 The new figure is also considered the highest announced daily COVID-19 tally so far this year, data showed. The country also reported a record-daily high on Thursday, when the DOH logged 3,749 infections. It does not, however, include data from the 5 DOH-accredited laboratories that failed to submit results on time. Active cases reached 52,012, with 92.2 percent of the patients experiencing mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, according to the health department. RELATED VIDEO: The total number of active infections is also considered the highest since October 17 last year, ABS-CBN Data Analytics Head Edson Guido said. It was also the day when active cases last breached 50,000, he said.\u00a0 Deaths rose to 12,694 after the DOH logged 87 more COVID-related fatalities.\u00a0 ABS-CBN IRG also noted that the day's deaths is the highest announced by DOH in a single day since Feb. 20, when the agency announced 239 deaths. Recoveries, meanwhile, increased by 272 to 546,912, data showed. Out of the 32,156 individuals who underwent testing for COVID-19, some 3,425 or 10.7 percent yielded positive for the disease.\u00a0 BREAKDOWN OF NEW CASES According to Guido, almost half or 2,158 of the newly-reported cases came from Metro Manila, the highest daily increase since Sept. 14 last year.\u00a0 NCR was followed by Calabarzon with 625. This is the highest daily tally from the region since Oct. 17 last year, he said.\u00a0 Topping the list of cities with the highest recorded cases on Friday were Quezon City with 481, Pasay with 280, Manila with 276, Bulacan with 260, Cavite with 225, and Rizal with 186.\u00a0 A total of 8 duplicates, meanwhile, have been removed from the cumulative tally, said the health department. Five of those were recoveries while a case was a fatality.\u00a0 Some 26 cases previously identified as recoveries also turned out to be deaths after the agency's final validation.\u00a0 The OCTA Research group earlier in the day projected the daily cases in the country to reach over 6,500 by end March, should the rate of infections become uncontrolled.\u00a0 They also pointed out that the capital region alone might also record some 4,000 new cases at the end of the month, due to its increasing reproduction value. Because of this, the team of researchers urged local government units to implement stricter health measures, including localized lockdowns and border controls.\u00a0 The country's top health officials earlier denied that the detected presence of COVID-19 variants locally led to the recent spike of infections, and blamed the public becoming more \"lax\" in observing minimum health protocols.\u00a0"

        "content": "MANILA \u2014 The Department of Health on Friday revealed that while it has been regularly holding biddings, the country has yet to clinch an agreement with a cold storage facility. \u201cThe bidding has been continuous naman. It has been regular. Ang problema, halos lahat nadisqualify doon sa initial run ng aming procurement kasi may mga requirements kami based on our terms of reference that was not able to be complied with these 3rd party logistics na nag-apply sa amin,\u201d Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire said during a briefing. (The bidding has been continuous. It has been regular. The problem is that almost all were disqualified during the initial run of our procurement because we have a requirement based on the terms of reference that was not complied with the 3rd party logistics applying.) Vergeire explained that government procurement laws state that they can only provide the payment once the service is rendered or there are receivables already. \u201cI think because of this big transaction medyo may issue \u2019yan sa mga nagbi-bid na 3rd party logistics kasi wala pwedeng ibigay na parang advance payment,\u201d she said. (I think since this is a big transaction the 3rd party logistics companies have an issue with that because they are unable to receive advance payment.) Vergeire said the department could not change the system since it is part of the law followed when it comes to bidding. The health official said the DOH currently does not have problems because there is enough capacity in government facilities and that there are groups helping them. \u201cTinitignan lang natin, kailangan lang natin maisiguro na meron tayong makuha dahil \u2019pag dumating na \u2019yung most of the bulk na ino-order nating bakuna kakailanganin talaga natin itong logistics firm na ito,\u201d she said. (We just need to ensure that we get one once the bulk orders of vaccines come in because we really need a logistics firm.) So far, the country has received more than a million vaccines from AstraZeneca and Sinovac. The government, which is expecting more shipments in the coming months, is aiming to inoculate up to 70 million Filipinos, which will require 140 million doses, before the end of the year.\u00a0 While most vaccines will only require regular refrigerator temperature, messenger RNA vaccines such as that of Pfizer and Moderna, which are both expected to arrive in the Philippines, require ultra cold storage to keep the doses frozen."

        "content": "MANILA \u2014 The Department of Health assured the public on Friday that the government has enough time to administer the 2nd dose of AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines before they expire in May, saying none of the vaccines on emergency use around the world have a lengthy shelf life.\u00a0 Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire on Friday belied reports that the government was rushing to administer the AstraZeneca vaccines because they are about to expire.\u00a0 The country earlier received 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines and 600,000 doses from Sinovac. \u201cWala pong bakunang dinevelop ngayon under the emergency use authority all over the world na may mahabang expiry date,\u201d Vergeire said during a briefing. (There is no vaccine that was just developed and under emergency use authority all over the world that has a long expiry date.) The vaccines of AstraZeneca and Sinovac were both given emergency use authorization by the Philippine government. While they are still under development, they were already allowed for public use through the government program because of the emergency situation. \u201cAng pinakamahabang expiry date ng mga bakuna sa ngayon 6 months dahil alam ng manufacturers evolving ang ating sitwasyon at maaaring baguhin o iayos ang mga bakunang inilagay nila dyan sa pinapagamit sa mga bansa kaya ganun lang ang expiry,\u201d Vergeire said. (The longest expiry date for vaccines for now is 6 months because the manufacturers know that the situation is evolving and that they may change or correct the vaccines that they are allowing countries to use. That\u2019s why the expiry date is like that.) \u201c'Yung dumating po sa atin 'yan po ang expiry sa end ng May,\u201d Vergeire said.\u00a0 \u201cPero nakaayos ang strategies natin because ang 2nd dose po n'yan you can give from 4 weeks to 12 weeks. So pasok na pasok ang ating schedule at aabot naman sa lahat ang pagbabakuna.\u201d (The ones that arrived here expire by the end of May. But our strategies are in place because the 2nd dose can be given from 4 to 12 weeks. So it is within our schedule and the doses can be used for vaccination.) Vergeire said the only reason they are trying to hasten the vaccination process is to ensure that health workers are vaccinated. As of March 10, 114,615 health workers have already been vaccinated against COVID-19. Vergeire said the 114,615 vaccinated represent 11.2% of the over 1 million health workers on the government's priority list.\u00a0 Majority or 101,827 of those vaccinated received Sinovac jabs while 12,788 received doses from AstraZeneca. \u201cThe top 3 regions with the highest coverage for Sinovac are the National Capital Region with 40.7%, CAR (Cordillera Administrative Region) at 13.9% and Region 12 at 11.7%,\u201d Vergeire said. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca, which arrived a week later than Sinovac, is being used in the National Capital Region, Cordillera Administrative Region, Region 1 and Region 4A. The country hopes to vaccinate up to 70 million Filipinos by the end of the year in a bid to reach herd immunity. However, some have criticized the government for the seemingly slow rollout of vaccines.\u00a0 Vergeire said it is just slow because they have just started, adding the pace would be quicker eventually. She said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III already raised the issue and they have been talking to vaccination units to hasten the process."

        "content": "MANILA (UPDATED)\u2014 The Philippines might record over 6,500 new daily COVID-19 cases by the end of March, the OCTA Research group warned Friday, as it urged local governments to impose stricter measures to control the virus spread.\u00a0 In a report, the team of researchers said Metro Manila alone may record up to over 4,000 new daily COVID-19 infections at the end of the month, as it also continues to log most of the new daily COVID-19 infections in the Philippines due to the increase in reproduction number (R) in the region at 1.86.\u00a0 The R number indicates the rate of spread of the disease. An R value above 1 can lead to exponential growth. \"In the February 17 report, the number of new COVID-19 cases in NCR was projected to reach 2,000 on March 22. It appears that the current trend is faster, as the region tallied nearly 2,000 cases on March 11, 11 days earlier than projected,\" the experts explained.\u00a0 The development came as the country reported 3,749 new cases on Thursday, the highest in a day since September last year. OCTA said some 1,975 of these fresh infections came from Metro Manila alone. \"It is important that the increase in new cases in the NCR be curbed in order to avoid a high number of new cases in NCR and to prevent overwhelming the hospitals of NCR and the regions surrounding NCR (Cavite, Rizal, Bulacan),\" the group said. Aside from the increase in R value, the researchers also pointed out that the average daily attack rate (ADAR) in the region is now at 11 per 100,000. This puts the region at \"high risk,\" they said.\u00a0 ADAR is the number of new cases in a city or province over a two-week period, divided by the population of the city or province. RELATED VIDEO: 12 NCR cities included in 15 LGUs with high daily cases Quezon City topped the areas in the country that recorded new COVID-19 cases in the past week, averaging with 274 confirmed infections daily.\u00a0 The group added that aside from QC, 11 other cities in Metro Manila were included in the top 15 areas that logged a high number of newly-reported infections between Mar. 5 to Mar. 11.\u00a0 Local chief executives in the Metro on Thursday night agreed to reintroduce a two-week curfew hours starting on Monday, March 15, in a bid to contain the virus.\u00a0 Researchers however belief the curfew is not enough.\u00a0 The local government should now also intervene to prevent inundating hospitals, and \"put an end to this surge,\" they said.\u00a0 \"Localized lockdowns have been shown to be effective in slowing down increasing trends in new cases. Additional restrictions such as curfews, border controls, reduced capacity in certain establishments, limitations in social gatherings... as well as continued monitoring and strict implementation by the local governments will hopefully slow down the rate of infection in NCR,\" the report read.\u00a0 The country's top health officials earlier denied that the detected presence of COVID-19 variants locally led to the recent spike of infections, and blamed the public becoming more \"lax\" in observing minimum health protocols. But a survey conducted by the same group of researchers showed that a majority of Filipinos complied with wearing face masks and washing of hands when they go out of their homes, but many failed to abide by physical distancing measures.\u00a0 - With a report from Kristine Sabillo, ABS-CBN News"

        "content": "MANILA \u2014 Some 1,000 health workers have reported minor side effects after inoculations against COVID-19, the Department of Health (DOH) said Friday, as the government races to vaccinate more health and essential workers.\u00a0 Philippines has so far vaccinated 114,615 health workers as of March 10, and \"a total of 978 suspected adverse events\" have been reported after immunization, said Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire.\u00a0 \u201cDito sa 978, (a total of) 892 are from the CoronaVac or from the Sinovac,\u201d she added. Majority or 872 of those side effects that happened after the use of Sinovac vaccines are \u201cnon-serious\u201d while 20 cases are considered serious Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFIs). For AstraZeneca, 85 recipients reported minor adverse events following immunization, and only one reported a serious side effect, Vergeire said. Among the common mild effects reported were muscle pain, pain on the injection site, body pains, fever and rashes, she said.\u00a0 Vergeire added that some of the patients who experienced these were given medicine and immediately recovered and went home. All were observed for 15 or 30 minutes after vaccination for possible side effects. \u201cUsual lang po yan. Hindi po dapat ikatakot,\u201d Vergeire said, adding that these are the same side effects experienced by children who are vaccinated. (These are usual side effects and should not be a cause of fear.) \u201cMeron pong mga serious side effects or adverse events na mga nangyayari kung saan ang mga kababayan natin yung iba nahihirapang huminga. Yung iba ay may sumakit ang dibdib. Ito po ay kinoconsider natin na serious at pinag-aaralan po kung ano ang causality nito,\u201d she said. (There are also serious side effects of adverse events that happened where some of our patients had trouble breathing. There were some who had chest pains. These are considered serious and we are studying the cause.) Vergeire said the head of the National Adverse Events Following Immunization Committee or NAEFIC believes that some of the reported cases can be attributed to anxiety. \u201cAlam niyo po yung takot ng ating mga kababayan pag magpapabakuna. Baka sila magkaside effect o natakot sa karayom,\u201d she said. (You know how some Filipinos are scared of being vaccinated. Maybe they are also scared of having side effects or they are scared of the needle.) The World Health Organization defines AEFI as \u201cany untoward medical occurrence which follows immunization and which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine.\u201d In the WHO\u2019s Global Manual on Surveillance of Adverse Events Following Immunization, there are different categorizations of AEFI. This includes vaccine product-related reaction, vaccine quality defect, immunization error, immunization anxiety, and coincidental events. The Philippines has received 600,000 Sinovac doses as a donation from China. It also received 525,600 AstraZeneca doses from the vaccine-sharing initiative COVAX Facility."

        "content": "MANILA (UPDATE) - PDP-Laban president Sen. Manny Pacquiao on Friday warned Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi not to \"poison\" and \"divide\" the minds of the ruling party's members amid talk of the group's lineup for the 2022 presidential elections despite the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Cusi is allegedly among PDP-Laban members who have been going around the country to push Sen. Christopher \"Bong\" Go and President Rodrigo Duterte to run for president and vice president, respectively. \"Si Cusi naman, hindi ako nakikipagaway sa iyo [pero] hindi ako ang tao na puwede mo lang laru-laruin,\" Pacquiao said in a press conference. (As for Cusi, I am not quarreling with you but I am not the person you can toy with.) \"Kung umiikot ka, pulitika pinaguusapan mo, 'wag mo lasunin ang mga utak ng mga miyembro ng partido para magkahiwa-hiwalay,\" he said. (If you are going around the country, talking about politics, do not poison the minds of the party members and sow division.) \"Warning lang ito. Hindi ako nakikipagaway sa iyo. Gusto ko makipagkaibigan sa iyo,\" said the boxer-turned-lawmaker. (This is just a warning. I am not quarreling with you. I want to befriend you.) Pacquiao reminded the energy secretary not to walk back on his earlier statement that PDP-Laban should prioritize the COVID-19 pandemic over politics. \"Sabi mo 'wag muna pulitka, tulong muna sa tao... 'Yung salita mo, paninindigan mo. 'Wag mong kainin 'yung salita mo,\" Pacquiao said when asked to comment on Cusi, who sits as the party's vice chairman. (You said the people should be the priority and not politics... You should stick to your word. Do not eat what you said.) Earlier this week, several PDP-Laban members signed a resolution pushing for Duterte to run for Vice President in 2022, citing the need for the \"continuity of the Government\u2019s 10-point Socioeconomic Agenda.\" On the same day, Duterte said his long-time ally Sen. Bong Go wants to become President. The latter said the president was just joking, but added he would only run if Duterte seeks the vice presidency. Pacquiao said the resolution is not official. \"Hindi legitimate 'yung resolution na ginawa. Nalaman ko lang 'yun dahil sinabi sa'kin ng tao ko,\" he said. (The resolution is illegitimate. I only knew about it because one of my staff told me.) PDP-Laban members who would continuously defy the order to refrain from talking about the 2022 national elections at this time would be \"dealt with,\" Pacquiao said. \"Karapatan ko na aksyunan ano man ang ginagawa ng lahat ng miyembro ng partido. Karapatan kong ituwid kung ano man ang mali,\" he said. (It is my right to sanction the activities of party members. It is my right to correct any mistake.) \"Napakaaga pa. Ang pag-usapan natin tulong dahil maraming tao ang magugutom,\" he said. (It is still too early. We should talk about helping others because a lot of people would go hungry.) CUSI SAYS NOT BEHIND DUTERTE-FOR-VP CALL\u00a0 Cusi, meanwhile, belied allegations he was sowing division within the party, saying the matter of Duterte possibly running as vice president next year was brought up by participants of the party's consultative assemblies in Manila, Cebu and Davao. \"This is the collective sentiment of the leaders on the ground. It did not come from me,\" Cusi said in a statement released hours after Pacquiao's press conference. \"I am just one member and the decision should be a collective action of the whole. This should be the guiding principle too in the choice of our party officers,\" he said. Pacquiao became PDP-Laban president in December 2020, while House Speaker Lord Allan Velasco was installed as acting executive vice president. This is the second time PDP-Laban was embroiled in allegations of infighting months before an election. In 2018, a group from Mindanao claiming to be party members held an event at the Quezon Memorial Circle criticizing then PDP-Laban Secretary General Pantaleon Alvarez. RELATED VIDEO"

Sa panayam sa TeleRadyo Biyernes ng umaga, sinabi ni Jimenez na isa sa makikita muli ng mga botante sa mga polling precinct ay ang pagkakaroon ng polling booths. \u201cFor the first time in a very long time magkakaroon tayo ng polling booths para isolated pa rin sila kahit sila ay bumoboto and then after that sila ay magi-indelible ink at aalis na po. Pero bago pa man makaboto, kailangang masagutan muna nila nang mas maaga ang health declaration form bago pumunta sa polling precinct. \u201cKung wala silang na-fillout ahead of time, meron naman health declaration form doon so kailangan pa rin nilang mag-accomplish nun. Pag na-accomplish na nila 'yun, pwede silang magtungo doon sa tinatawag nating voters assistance desk,\u201d sabi ni Jimenez. Dito, tutulungan sila ng mga volunteers para malaman kung saang presinto at anong kuwarto sila naka-assign sa mismong botohan. Pagpunta sa polling place, kukuha ng balota pero kailangang dumaan muna sa health screening. \u201cMagkakaroon ng temperature check at titingnan kung sila ay walang sintomas ng COVID-19. Kapag sila ay may iprinesentang sintomas o \u2018di kaya mataas ang temperatura nila, sila ay dadalhin sa tinatawag na isolation polling place o IPP at doon po sila makakaboto,\u201d paliwanag niya. Nasa mga 5 katao lamang ang papayagan sa loob ng polling precinct para masunod pa rin ang physical distancing. Sa Sabado, Marso 13, gaganapin ang plebisito kung saan boboto ng \"Yes\" o \"No\" ang mga Palawe\u00f1os sa paghahati ng Palawan sa tatlong probinsiya ng Palawan del Norte, Palawan Oriental, at Palawan del Sur.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nNasa kabuuang 490,639 ang registered voters ng Palawan na maaring lumahok sa plebisito."

        "author": "ABS-CBN News",
        "content": "MANILA (3RD UPDATE) - The National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) on Friday filed several criminal charges against companions of flight attendant Christine Dacera at the Makati hotel where she had spent her final hours.\u00a0 The NBI Death Investigation Division filed obstruction of justice charges against Mark Rosales, Rommel Galido, John Dela Serna, Gregorio De Guzman, Jezreel Rapinan, Alain Chen, Reymay Englis, and Darwin Macalla, who partied with Dacera at the City Garden Grand Hotel in Makati City prior to her death on New Year's Day.\u00a0 The NBI said they were charged for \u201cgiving false or fabricated information to mislead or prevent the law enforcement agencies from apprehending the offenders.\u201d\u00a0 The NBI also filed an obstruction of justice charge against their legal counsel Neptali Maroto, and found evidence to recommend charges of reckless imprudence resulting in homicide against Dela Serna, Rapinan, Chen, and Louie De Lima.\u00a0 In a press conference Friday, Zylykha Marie Corales Deramo of the NBI said that while the occupants of room 2209 did not intend to kill Dacera, they lacked \"proper diligence and prudence\" when Dacera had already been experiencing weakness that ultimately led to her death.\u00a0 As they partied, occupants of room 2207, where Dacera, 23, had stayed momentarily, allegedly went to 2209 to tell her companions that she was vomiting and experiencing a headache.\u00a0 Her companions supposedly downplayed this.\u00a0 \u201cKung ako nakikita ko ang aking kaibigan na nagsusuka, masakit ang ulo, gagawin ko bibigyan ko ng gamot or seek immediate assistance,\u201d Deramo said.\u00a0 (If I see my friend vomiting, having headaches, I will give them medicine or seek immediate assistance.)\u00a0 She said Dacera complained to those in room 2207, who she just met that night, that she was feeling numb and breathless.\u00a0 Deramo continued: \"Dahil sa kakaunting panahon na kasama ni Tin ang occupants ng Room 2207 ay nakita nila na humihingal at nahihrapang huminga, nagsabing numb ang kanyang katawan. And yet 'yung occupants ng room 2209 who were with her for such a long time failed to observe the littlest of these details, which to us is very impossible.\"\u00a0 (In the short time Dacera was with the occupants of Room 2207, they saw her panting and having a hard time breathing, she even said that her body was feeling numb. And yet, the occupants of Room 2209, who were with her for such a long time failed to observe the littlest of these details, which to us is very impossible.)\u00a0 She added: \u201cYou did not intend to kill anybody but the omission to the proper diligence and prudence at that time and place\u2026 You are liable in the law kaya namin sila kinasuhan.\"\u00a0 NBI also found evidence to recommend reckless imprudence resulting in homicide against Dela Serna, Rapinan, Chen & Delima pic.twitter.com/LT5uYeK74E  The NBI also recommended filing perjury charges against Galido, Dela Serna and Macalla.\u00a0 Rosales and Galido are, meanwhile, facing illegal drug charges after the NBI investigation showed that both Rosales and Galido allegedly tried to deliver or give away illegal drugs at the New Year party. Rosales is also facing a separate charge for allegedly introducing the party drugs to his companions.\u00a0 \"There was presence of dangerous drugs, fluoromethamphetamine 'yung suka doon sa room 2209. We have testimonial pieces of evidence and then itong forensic report ng SOCO, and then mayroon din itong (there is this) testimony galing kay (from) Jake Esperon that he was offered illegal drugs and it was also testified that Mark showed him powdered drugs. He pulled the powdered drugs from his socks,\" NBI Spokesperson Ferdinand Lavin said at the briefing. The NBI also filed falsification of public documents charges against Southern Police District Medico Legal Officer Police Maj. Michael Sarmiento, who conducted the autopsy on Dacera. Dacera was found unconscious and without a pulse in a bathtub at the Makati hotel around 12:30 p.m. on January 1 after a night of partying. Her friends said they tried to revive her and brought her to the Makati Medical Center, where she was later declared dead. Dacera and her friends had booked Room 2209 at City Garden Grand Hotel in Makati City to ring in the New Year. According to CCTV footage, they went back and forth to Room 2207 after being introduced to guests there.\u00a0 The PNP, in a medico-legal report, said Dacera died of natural causes, ruling out that her death on New Year\u2019s day was a crime after initially suspecting rape and homicide against her companions. This was later on refuted by her family. The NBI also said Dacera\u2019s friends did not give their statements despite multiple attempts for a request.\u00a0 However, they can still explain their side with the fiscal.\u00a0 ABS-CBN News also tried to seek the side of those facing charges, but they declined to give a statement pending the copy of the case filed by the NBI. \u2014 reports from Niko Baua and Angela Coloma, ABS-CBN News"

He has volunteered to be confined at the Kiangan treatment facility in Camp Crame. Usana said Police Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar, deputy chief for administration of PNP, would serve as the organization's officer-in-charge. In a statement, Sinas apologized for the \"relapse in the observance of mandatory health protocols.\" He was in Mindoro when he received his COVID-19 test results. In the past week, he also attended several events in the police headquarters such as the unveiling of a new monument, and the oath-taking and donning of newly promoted police officers. Last year, the then Metro Manila police director was charged for allegedly violating health protocols for holding a \"ma\u00f1anita\" or dawn serenade for his 55th birthday celebration.\u00a0 Despite public backlash, President Rodrigo Duterte cleared Sinas of any violation of COVID-19 rules. In the interview, Usana said they were also waiting for additional COVID-19 vaccines to be administered to their frontline workers. So far, the PNP has received about 1,200 doses from the national government, he said. These were used to inoculate police officers working in the health service. To date, the PNP has logged 12,001 coronavirus infections, of which 11,217 recovered while 32 died. It currently has 752 patients deemed infectious or active cases. RELATED VIDEO"

Dahil dito, sumirit na sa 611,618 ang kabuuang dami ng nagpositibo sa sakit, at 52,012 dito ay nananatiling aktibo, sabi ng Department of Health.\u00a0 Umabot naman sa 12,694 ang bilang ng mga nasawi sa sakit matapos makapagtala ng 87 bagong pagkamatay. Nakapagtala din ng 272 bagong recoveries kaya nasa 546,912 ang gumaling sa sakit.\u00a0 Kasabay ng pagdami ng naitatalang kaso ay ang pagpapatupad muli ng iba't ibang restriksiyon, tulad ng curfew, sa maraming lugar partikular na sa Metro Manila.\u00a0 Nauna nang sinabi ng OCTA Research Group na posibleng may kinalaman ang iba't ibang variant ng COVID-19 virus sa nakikitang pagdami ng kaso. 'LAGPAS-DOBLE' Ayon sa OCTA Research Group, umabot na umano sa mahigit 1,500 ang weekly average ng bagong COVID-19 cases sa Metro Manila noong nakaraang linggo. Pero bagaman nakatutok ang mga tao sa NCR, nakikitaan din ng pagtaas ang Calabarzon at Central Luzon regions. Sa analysis ng ABS-CBN Data Analytics team gamit ang DOH data, nasa 141 percent o mas malaki pa sa doble ang itinaas ng mga kaso ng COVID-19 sa NCR nitong huling 2 linggo.\u00a0 Tinitingnan ngayon ng DOH ang iba\u2019t ibang dahilan ng pagtaas ng kaso, kasama na ang mga mas nakakahawa umanong variants. Malaki rin umanong problema ang hindi pa rin pagsunod sa health protocols ngunit mayroon ding iba pang nakikitang sanhi ng pagkalat ng sakit.\u00a0 \"Nakita natin itong home quarantine ang mga tao hindi na nailagay sa facilities for isolation or quarantine.

Dahil sa pagtaas ng mga kaso, problemado ang iba\u2019t ibang ospital. \"'Yun pong ICU namin ang almost puno na,\" ani Philippine General Hospital spokesperson Dr. Jonas del Rosario. \u2014May ulat ni Kristine Sabillo, ABS-CBN News"

Autopsy is expected to uncover how they died. The activists were among the nine casualties in violent police raids in Calabarzon region last Sunday, in which several other activists were also arrested. The custody of their remains were earlier tensely contested by police and their kin after authorities claimed the local government offered funeral arrangements for them.\u00a0 But the families, represented by the National Union of People's Lawyers (NUPL), asserted the kin of the deceased have to go under proper autopsy first to learn how they died. The United Nations' human rights office has criticized the arbitrary killings of the nine activists in Calabarzon.

(Why did it end up with so much violence when it was only serving search warrants?) The police and military on Sunday implemented 24 search warrants in Calabarzon that left 9 activists dead and 3 others arrested. Nine other subjects -- 1 in Batangas and 8 in Rizal -- remain at large. Among those killed were Manny Asuncion, coordinator of activist group Bagong Alyansang Makabayan in Cavite, and fisherfolk leaders Chai Lemita-Evangelista and Ariel Evangelista in Batangas. The operations came 2 days after President Rodrigo Duterte told state forces to ignore human rights and \u201cfinish off\u201d communist rebels. Hontiveros stressed that the victims were non-combatants but were instead leaders and organizers of different causes. \"Dapat hinding-hindi na maulit ito dahil nagiging pattern na nga. Parang tuloy-tuloy 'yong ganitong napakasaklap na kaganapan,\" she said. (This should not happen again because it has become a pattern. It seems like these tragic events kept on happening.) On Thursday, the bodies of several activists killed in the \"Bloody Sunday\" raids were released from a morgue in Antipolo City. It capped off nearly a week of standoff between police and their kin over the custody of their remains. The United Nations' human rights office has criticized the arbitrary killings of the 9 activists in Calabarzon. Justice Secretary Menardo Guevarra had said his department would endorse to the country's inter-agency task group on extrajudicial killings the investigation of the slay of the activists. The police, however, maintained the operation was legitimate and those killed were allegedly \"involved in some kind of terror operation.\""

Ayon sa imbestigasyon ng awtoridad, pumalaot si Balayo kasama ang 2 kaibigan upang ayusin ang nasirang fish pen. Nakadalawang sisid na umano si Balayo subalit sa ikatlong beses nito ay hindi na ito nakaakyat pa. Agad na hinanap ng 2 kasamahan ang biktima at makalipas ang ilang minuto ay nakita nila ang katawan nito sa may fish pen. Agad na dinala sa ospital ang biktima subalit ideneklara na itong dead on arrival. \n\u2014Ulat ni Rolen Escaniel"

        "content": "MANILA - Former PDP-Laban president Sen. Aquilino Pimentel III on Friday called on his colleagues in the ruling party to refrain from discussing politics as the country continued to reel from the COVID-19 pandemic. Talking about politics during this period \"is not a good time,\" Pimentel told reporters in a text message.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\"I agree with the call of Sec. Cusi. This is not a good time to talk about politics,\" Pimentel said, referring to party president Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi's earlier call on party members to refrain from discussing politics.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\nPimentel said this a day after a group of administration party stalwarts openly called on President Rodrigo Duterte to run as Vice President in the 2022 elections, when his term ends.\u00a0 On the same day, Duterte said in a speech that his long-time ally Sen. Christopher \u201cBong\u201d Go wants to become President, which the latter quickly dismissed in a prepared statement as a \"joke.\" The President said this shortly after he and his former close aide topped a recent survey about possible presidential-vice presidential tandems in the 2022 elections.\r\n\u00a0\r\n\"Biro lang ng Pangulo iyon... Please count me out sa usaping pulitika sa 2022,\" Go said.\r\n\u00a0\r\n(The President was just joking... Please count me out on political talk for 2022.) \"Magbabago lang siguro ang isip ko kung tatakbong Vice President si Pangulong Duterte,\" he said.\u00a0\r\n\u00a0\r\n(I probably will only change my mind if President Duterte decides to run for vice president.)
