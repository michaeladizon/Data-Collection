        "content": "MAYNILA \u2014 Sa darating na Lunes ay ipatutupad na sa Metro Manila ang unified curfew na aarangkada mula alas-10 ng gabi hanggang alas-5 ng umaga, na inaasahang makatulong sa pagkontrol ng pagkalat ng COVID-19. Para sa ilang mga tao, makatutulong ang pagkakasundo ng Metro Manila mayors sa unified curfew para mabawasan ang kalituhan, lalo't iba-iba noon ang patakaran ng bawat lokal na pamahalaan.\u00a0 Pero ang ilan, hindi masaya, katulad ni Aling Charito na may karinderya. Ang regular daw kasi nilang pamamalengke ay alas-3 ng madaling araw kaya kapag may curfew ay maaantala ang kanilang pamimili at pagluluto ng almusal para sa kostumer.\u00a0 \"Mawawala po 'yung mga kakain ng almusal sa amin,\" aniya.\u00a0 Umaaray din ang mga jeep at tricycle driver dahil mababawasan daw ang kanilang kita, lalo na't lumiit ito dahil sa pandemic. Ayon kay Antonio Gomez, tricycle driver, malamang ay wala na silang makuhang pasahero sa pila ng tricycle. \"Laking epekto sa 'min na walang kita. Sana maibalik ang dati. [Pero] wala tayong magagawa, sunod na lang tayo,\" aniya. Ang jeepney driver naman na si Jessy Soledad, naghahanda na sa mas maliit na kita. \"Magiging apektado kasi konti ang pasahero... Iiksi ang oras. Sa kita namin apektado din,\" hinaing niya. Giit ng hepe ng Quezon City Department of Public Safety and Order, tuloy ang pagpapatupad nila ng unified curfew pero may mga exemption naman daw. Kabilang dito ang mga nasa graveyard shift, delivery ng essential services, at iba pang maituturing na frontliners. Dalawang linggo lang dapat ito ipatupad ang unified curfew pero posibleng ma-extend. Nangangamba naman ang Employers' Confederation of the Philippines (ECOP) para sa mga manggagawang aabutin ng curfew sa kalsada. Sabi ni ECOP president Sergio Ortiz-Luis Jr., umaasa silang magbibigay ng \"pass\" ang mga lokal na pamahalaan para sa mga manggagawang maaapektuhan ng curfew.\r\n\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u2014Ulat ni Zyann Ambrosio, ABS-CBN News"

Sabi pa ng LGU, naroon ang opisyal kasama ang team ng PHO para mapag-usapan ang vaccination rollout at contact tracing para sa mga naging contact o na-expose sa mga nagpositibo sa COVID-19 na pulis.\u00a0 Hindi raw dumaan sa pantalan ng Calapan si Sinas, bagkus dumiretso na agad si regional office, kaya walang gaanong contact sa mga empleyado ng provincial government.\u00a0 Ayon naman sa source ng ABS-CBN News sasailalim sa swab test ang mga opisyal ng PNP na mayroong close contact kay Sinas.\u00a0 Pero sa sa panayam sa telepono sa ABS-CBN News hindi pa ito kinukumpirma ng PIO ng PNP Mimaropa.\u00a0 Sa inilabas na pahayag ng Mimaropa PNP, ipinag-utos ang malawakang contact tracing sa mga police personnel na nakasalamuha ni Sinas. Naka-quarantine naman ngayon ang regional director ng Mimaropa PNP na si Police Brig. Gen. Pascual Munoz Jr. Humingi ito ng panalangin para sa agarang paggaling ng kanilang PNP Chief.

Dahil dito, sumirit na sa 611,618 ang kabuuang dami ng nagpositibo sa sakit, at 52,012 dito ay nananatiling aktibo, sabi ng Department of Health.\u00a0 Umabot naman sa 12,694 ang bilang ng mga nasawi sa sakit matapos makapagtala ng 87 bagong pagkamatay. Nakapagtala din ng 272 bagong recoveries kaya nasa 546,912 ang gumaling sa sakit.\u00a0 Kasabay ng pagdami ng naitatalang kaso ay ang pagpapatupad muli ng iba't ibang restriksiyon, tulad ng curfew, sa maraming lugar partikular na sa Metro Manila.\u00a0 Nauna nang sinabi ng OCTA Research Group na posibleng may kinalaman ang iba't ibang variant ng COVID-19 virus sa nakikitang pagdami ng kaso. 'LAGPAS-DOBLE' Ayon sa OCTA Research Group, umabot na umano sa mahigit 1,500 ang weekly average ng bagong COVID-19 cases sa Metro Manila noong nakaraang linggo. Pero bagaman nakatutok ang mga tao sa NCR, nakikitaan din ng pagtaas ang Calabarzon at Central Luzon regions. Sa analysis ng ABS-CBN Data Analytics team gamit ang DOH data, nasa 141 percent o mas malaki pa sa doble ang itinaas ng mga kaso ng COVID-19 sa NCR nitong huling 2 linggo.\u00a0 Tinitingnan ngayon ng DOH ang iba\u2019t ibang dahilan ng pagtaas ng kaso, kasama na ang mga mas nakakahawa umanong variants. Malaki rin umanong problema ang hindi pa rin pagsunod sa health protocols ngunit mayroon ding iba pang nakikitang sanhi ng pagkalat ng sakit.\u00a0 \"Nakita natin itong home quarantine ang mga tao hindi na nailagay sa facilities for isolation or quarantine. Maaaring sa kagustuhan ng pami-pamilya pero ngayong nakikita natin ang pagtaas ng mga kaso, kailangan nating paghigpitan ito para di na siya maka-contribute dito sa pagkalat,\" ani DOH spokesperson Maria Rosario Vergeire.\u00a0 Nakikita ring problema ang hindi maayos na ventilation o daloy ng hangin at mga protocol sa pagpasok sa mga establisimyento. Dahil sa pagtaas ng mga kaso, problemado ang iba\u2019t ibang ospital. \"'Yun pong ICU namin ang almost puno na,\" ani Philippine General Hospital spokesperson Dr. Jonas del Rosario. \u2014May ulat ni Kristine Sabillo, ABS-CBN News"

        "author": "Angela Coloma, ABS-CBN News",
        "content": "MANILA (UPDATE) - Traces of drugs were found in the Makati hotel room where Christine Dacera and her friends stayed before her death on New Year\u2019s Day, results of the National Bureau of Investigation probe showed.\u00a0 This was among the evidence the NBI used as basis to file several criminal charges, including drug-related complaints, obstruction of justice, perjury and reckless imprudence resulting in homicide against 11 people, including Dacera\u2019s companions at the time.\u00a0 Mark Anthony Rosales and Rommel Galido were charged for illegal drug use, as they allegedly tried to deliver or give away drugs at the party, on top of the obstruction of justice charges filed by the NBI against them and their other companions.\u00a0 Apart from Rosales and Galido, John Dela Serna, Gregorio De Guzman, Jezreel Rapinan, Alain Chen, Reymay Englis, and Darwin Macalla are also facing obstruction of justice charges.\u00a0 The parallel investigation requested by Dacera\u2019s family found that there was drug use at Room 2209 of the City Garden Grand Hotel, where Dacera and her friends stayed, based on statements by witnesses who were at the scene of the incident.\u00a0 Crime scene investigation found traces of fluoromethamphetamine and methamphetamine, both stimulant drugs, in vomit near the toilet bowl where Dacera had puked in the wee hours of January 1.\u00a0 \"One of the matters taken by SOCO (Scene of the Crime Operatives) at vomitous matter at around 6:39, makikita mo si Tin sa harap ng toilet bowl by the occupants of room 2209 so 'yung portion na 'yon, 'yung vomitous matter na 'yun was taken in the forensic [examination]. That vomitous matter has presence of 4 flouromethamphetamine and methamphetamine so dalawa ang nakitang illegal drugs,\" Zylykha Marie Corales Deramo of the NBI said in a press conference.\u00a0 (You can see Tin in front of a toilet bowl and helped by the occupants of Room 2209, so that portion, that vomitous matter was taken in the forensic [examination]. That vomitous matter has presence of 4 flouromethamphetamine and methamphetamine so two types of illegal drugs were found.) Deramo also added that Dacera herself allegedly stayed at room 2207, the neighboring room, not wanting to be at room 2209 because there was an \u201corgy\u201d happening in the room and that they were high on drugs.\u00a0 \"When she (Tin) went to room 2207 she alleged na ayaw na niya doon kasi number one nag-o-orgy ang mga ito and number 2, shuas. When we asked the occupants of room 2207 kung ano ang shuas, apparently it\u2019s gay lingo for 'high',\u201d Deramo said.\u00a0 (When she went to Room 2207, she alleged that she does not want to be in [2209] because number 1, they were having an orgy and number 2, shuas. When we asked the occupants of room 2207 what shuas was, apparently it's gay lingo for 'high'.)\u00a0 A witness who spent the night at Room 2207 also said Rosales offered him drugs.\u00a0 \"One of the occupants of room 2207 ay nakapagsabi na pumasok siya sa room 2209, common friend niya si Rommel, nagsabi 'baks may party drugs kami, bet mo?' Sabi niya ayoko. Apparently, hindi siya user pero nagpumilit itong si Rommel, went to a friend and asked for such party drugs. Sinabi niya na 'sorry baks ubos na pala,' so no more, so that\u2019s corroboration,\" Deramo said.\u00a0 (One of the occupants of room 2207 said when he entered room 2209, Rommel said \"we have party drugs, want some?\" He said no. Apparently he's not a user but allegedly, Rommel insisted, went to a friend and asked for such party drugs. But then said \"sorry there's no more,\" so no more, so that's corroboration.) There was also \"insinuation\" that Dacera herself took drugs, she added, but the NBI did not categorically say she did. \"JP Dela Serna and Rommel Galido also insinuated na Tin also used, na gumamit, ang sabi niya 'Mali kasi 'yon ang ecstasy at alcohol kasi 'yung heartbeat' but did not mention who took what ecstasy,\" she said, adding that Dacera had allegedly disclosed to Garrido that her drink was spiked by Mark Rosales. (JP Dela Serna and Rommel Galido also insinuated that Tin also used, he said \"it's wrong, ecstasy and alcohol affects the heartbeat' but did not mention who took what ecstasy.) Findings by the NBI contradict statements by Dacera\u2019s companions that there was no drug use at the party.\u00a0 However, the \"interplay between drugs and alcohol\" at the incident, according to Deramo, was still \"not very clear.\" The reautopsy of Dacera\u2019s body showed that her cause of death was \u201cmicroscopic evidence of peri-aortic hemorrhages and aortic wall distruption.\u201d\u00a0 The toxicology report also showed that Dacera\u2019s body had traces of Diltiazem, a prescription drug for hypertension. Asked when illegal drugs may have caused her death, the NBI said it was \u201cmedically probable\u201d for drugs to have started the aortic rupture on her body, based on scientific evidence they have gathered.\u00a0 \"We\u2019re not saying Christine Dacera took Diltiazem that night. We\u2019re saying na she had been taking Diltiazem which has been found sa presence ng liver and then 'yung sa stomach. This is to help her condition,\" NBI Spokesperson Ferdinand Lavin said in the press conference.\u00a0 \"On the night when she took illegal drugs and alcohol, it defeated the purpose of which she was taking the Diltiazem. Natalo 'yung kaniyang Diltiazem because she knew na mayroon siyang condition (Her Diltiazem was overpowered because she knew that she had the condition),\u201d NBI Spokesperson Ferdinand Lavin said in the press conference.\u00a0 The NBI, meanwhile, said they cannot prove rape allegations, as there were no fresh abrasions found on her labia at the time, at par with evidence presented by the PNP. Police had initially suspected the case was one of rape with homicide.\u00a0 Dacera, 23 was found unconscious and without a pulse in a bathtub at the Makati hotel around 12:30 p.m. on January 1 after a night of partying. Her friends said they tried to revive her and brought her to the Makati Medical Center, where she was later declared dead. Dacera and her friends had booked Room 2209 at City Garden Grand Hotel in Makati City to ring in the New Year. According to CCTV footage, they went back and forth to Room 2207 after being introduced to guests there.\u00a0 The PNP, in a medico-legal report, said Dacera died of natural causes, ruling out that her death on New Year\u2019s day was a crime after initially suspecting rape and homicide against her companions.

Manny Pacquiao on Friday said a supposed party resolution urging President Rodrigo Duterte to run as vice president in the 2022 national elections is illegitimate. PDP-Laban has yet to finalize its line-up for the 2022 national elections, Pacquiao said in a press conference. \"Hindi legitimate 'yung resolution na ginawa. Nalaman ko lang 'yun dahil sinabi sa'kin ng tao ko,\" he said. (The resolution is illegitimate. I only knew about it because one of my staff told me.) \"Hindi ko alam 'yun. Hindi 'yun sanctioned as acting president ng partido,\" he said. (I did not know about it. It was not sanctioned [by me] as acting party president.) The said resolution, dated March 8, was signed mostly by mayors and lawmakers, Melvin Matibag, PDP-Laban deputy party secretary general, earlier told ABS-CBN News. Among the signatories were MMDA chairman Benhur Abalos, Mandaluyong Mayor Carmelita Abalos, Quezon City Rep. Alfred Vargas, and Para\u00f1aque City Mayor Edwin Olivares. Sen. Aquilino Pimentel III said differences among party members on whether or not Duterte should run as vice president should not be considered as infighting. \"'Wag ninyo i-characterize as infighting,\" Pimentel said. (Do not characterize it as infighting.) \"Sen. Manny Pacquiao is reminding the members to focus sa pagtulong. Darating 'yung time para sa pulitika. Hintayin natin 'yung time para sa pulitika,\" he said. (Sen. Manny Pacquiao is reminding the members to focus on helping. The time for politics will come. Let's wait for that time to come.) Pacquiao on Friday issued a \"warning\" against Energy Secretary Alfonso Cusi, the party vice-chair, who he said was sowing division within the group.\u00a0 The senator made the statement as he asked members to refrain from talking about the upcoming elections as the country continued to grapple with the COVID-19 pandemic.\u00a0 Cusi was allegedly among PDP-Laban members behind the resolution urging Duterte to run for vice president. On the same day the resolution was released, Duterte himself talked politics, saying his long-time ally Sen. Christopher \"Bong\" Go was aspiring to become president. Go denied this in a statement but said he might change his mind if the current chief executive would agree to run for vice president. DISCIPLINARY ACTION Pacquiao belied allegations that several party members were planning to break away from the ruling party, saying more politicians want to join PDP-Laban. \"Marami pang gusto mag oath, sumama sa partido. Sabi ko 'wag muna dahil pandemic pa, bawal pa,\" he said. (Many want to take their oath, join the party. I said not yet because the pandemic is still going.) When asked about conflicting statements being released by several PDP-Laban members, Pacquiao said: \"Inaayos na natin 'yung mga lumalabas na isyu.\" (We are already fixing the issues.) \"Aaksyunan namin 'yang mga ganiyan na hindi sumusunod sa partido,\" said Pacquiao, who boxing promoter Bob Arum last year said might also seek the presidency. (We will act on those who refuse to toe the party line.) Instead of disclosing specific sanctions against erring members, Pacquiao released a memo calling for unity within the party and directing all PDP-Laban members to avoid discussing politics at this time as the COVID-19 pandemic continues. \"I have the responsibility to enforce rules, promote cooperation, insist on civility and respect, and most of all, to remind you that we are one team,\" his memo read. \"Before we can truly solve the problems of the country, we must first focus on ourselves and our beloved party.\" This is not the first time PDP-Laban seemed divided months before an election. In 2018, a group from Mindanao claiming to be party members on Wednesday held an event at the Quezon Memorial Circle criticizing then PDP-Laban Secretary General Pantaleon Alvarez. The group, led by PDP-Laban national council chair Rogelio Garcia, slammed Alvarez for leading the mass-oath taking of new party members without complying with the application process.\u00a0 Old party members were not invited to PDP-Laban's 36th anniversary celebration at a hotel in Makati City, Garcia added. The group issued a resolution declaring Alvarez persona non grata from the party, but then-party president Pimentel denied that PDP-Laban had made such a declaration. In 2019, Alvarez accused the ruling party of keeping him in the dark about its decision to back Marinduque Rep. Lord Allan Velasco's bid for the House Speakership, which he was also vying for. Alvarez was hoping to make a comeback as Speaker after he was ousted from the post in 2018 in a coup maneuvered by the President's daughter, Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte. Then Pampanga Rep. Gloria Macapagal Arroyo was installed in his place. RELATED VIDEO"

This developed, as Metro Manila mayors agreed to reimpose a curfew for two weeks starting Monday, and the OCTA Research group sounded the alarm on the spike of infections in the capital region in recent weeks.\u00a0\u00a0 The day's fresh cases are the highest since last September 14, when the Department of Health (DOH) announced 4,699 confirmed infections, the ABS-CBN Investigative and Research Group said.\u00a0 The new figure is also considered the highest announced daily COVID-19 tally so far this year, data showed. The country also reported a record-daily high on Thursday, when the DOH logged 3,749 infections. It does not, however, include data from the 5 DOH-accredited laboratories that failed to submit results on time. Active cases reached 52,012, with 92.2 percent of the patients experiencing mild symptoms or are asymptomatic, according to the health department. RELATED VIDEO: The total number of active infections is also considered the highest since October 17 last year, ABS-CBN Data Analytics Head Edson Guido said. It was also the day when active cases last breached 50,000, he said.\u00a0 Deaths rose to 12,694 after the DOH logged 87 more COVID-related fatalities.\u00a0 ABS-CBN IRG also noted that the day's deaths is the highest announced by DOH in a single day since Feb. 20, when the agency announced 239 deaths. Recoveries, meanwhile, increased by 272 to 546,912, data showed. Out of the 32,156 individuals who underwent testing for COVID-19, some 3,425 or 10.7 percent yielded positive for the disease.\u00a0 BREAKDOWN OF NEW CASES According to Guido, almost half or 2,158 of the newly-reported cases came from Metro Manila, the highest daily increase since Sept. 14 last year.\u00a0 NCR was followed by Calabarzon with 625. This is the highest daily tally from the region since Oct. 17 last year, he said.\u00a0 Topping the list of cities with the highest recorded cases on Friday were Quezon City with 481, Pasay with 280, Manila with 276, Bulacan with 260, Cavite with 225, and Rizal with 186.\u00a0 A total of 8 duplicates, meanwhile, have been removed from the cumulative tally, said the health department. Five of those were recoveries while a case was a fatality.\u00a0 Some 26 cases previously identified as recoveries also turned out to be deaths after the agency's final validation.\u00a0 The OCTA Research group earlier in the day projected the daily cases in the country to reach over 6,500 by end March, should the rate of infections become uncontrolled.\u00a0 They also pointed out that the capital region alone might also record some 4,000 new cases at the end of the month, due to its increasing reproduction value. Because of this, the team of researchers urged local government units to implement stricter health measures, including localized lockdowns and border controls.\u00a0 The country's top health officials earlier denied that the detected presence of COVID-19 variants locally led to the recent spike of infections, and blamed the public becoming more \"lax\" in observing minimum health protocols.\u00a0"

        "author": "Kristine Sabillo, ABS-CBN News",
        "content": "MANILA \u2014 The Department of Health assured the public on Friday that the government has enough time to administer the 2nd dose of AstraZeneca\u2019s COVID-19 vaccines before they expire in May, saying none of the vaccines on emergency use around the world have a lengthy shelf life.\u00a0 Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire on Friday belied reports that the government was rushing to administer the AstraZeneca vaccines because they are about to expire.\u00a0 The country earlier received 525,600 doses of AstraZeneca vaccines and 600,000 doses from Sinovac. \u201cWala pong bakunang dinevelop ngayon under the emergency use authority all over the world na may mahabang expiry date,\u201d Vergeire said during a briefing. (There is no vaccine that was just developed and under emergency use authority all over the world that has a long expiry date.) The vaccines of AstraZeneca and Sinovac were both given emergency use authorization by the Philippine government. While they are still under development, they were already allowed for public use through the government program because of the emergency situation. \u201cAng pinakamahabang expiry date ng mga bakuna sa ngayon 6 months dahil alam ng manufacturers evolving ang ating sitwasyon at maaaring baguhin o iayos ang mga bakunang inilagay nila dyan sa pinapagamit sa mga bansa kaya ganun lang ang expiry,\u201d Vergeire said. (The longest expiry date for vaccines for now is 6 months because the manufacturers know that the situation is evolving and that they may change or correct the vaccines that they are allowing countries to use. That\u2019s why the expiry date is like that.) \u201c'Yung dumating po sa atin 'yan po ang expiry sa end ng May,\u201d Vergeire said.\u00a0 \u201cPero nakaayos ang strategies natin because ang 2nd dose po n'yan you can give from 4 weeks to 12 weeks. So pasok na pasok ang ating schedule at aabot naman sa lahat ang pagbabakuna.\u201d (The ones that arrived here expire by the end of May. But our strategies are in place because the 2nd dose can be given from 4 to 12 weeks. So it is within our schedule and the doses can be used for vaccination.) Vergeire said the only reason they are trying to hasten the vaccination process is to ensure that health workers are vaccinated. As of March 10, 114,615 health workers have already been vaccinated against COVID-19. Vergeire said the 114,615 vaccinated represent 11.2% of the over 1 million health workers on the government's priority list.\u00a0 Majority or 101,827 of those vaccinated received Sinovac jabs while 12,788 received doses from AstraZeneca. \u201cThe top 3 regions with the highest coverage for Sinovac are the National Capital Region with 40.7%, CAR (Cordillera Administrative Region) at 13.9% and Region 12 at 11.7%,\u201d Vergeire said. Meanwhile, AstraZeneca, which arrived a week later than Sinovac, is being used in the National Capital Region, Cordillera Administrative Region, Region 1 and Region 4A. The country hopes to vaccinate up to 70 million Filipinos by the end of the year in a bid to reach herd immunity. However, some have criticized the government for the seemingly slow rollout of vaccines.\u00a0 Vergeire said it is just slow because they have just started, adding the pace would be quicker eventually. She said Health Secretary Francisco Duque III already raised the issue and they have been talking to vaccination units to hasten the process."

An R value above 1 can lead to exponential growth. \"In the February 17 report, the number of new COVID-19 cases in NCR was projected to reach 2,000 on March 22. It appears that the current trend is faster, as the region tallied nearly 2,000 cases on March 11, 11 days earlier than projected,\" the experts explained.\u00a0 The development came as the country reported 3,749 new cases on Thursday, the highest in a day since September last year. OCTA said some 1,975 of these fresh infections came from Metro Manila alone. \"It is important that the increase in new cases in the NCR be curbed in order to avoid a high number of new cases in NCR and to prevent overwhelming the hospitals of NCR and the regions surrounding NCR (Cavite, Rizal, Bulacan),\" the group said. Aside from the increase in R value, the researchers also pointed out that the average daily attack rate (ADAR) in the region is now at 11 per 100,000. This puts the region at \"high risk,\" they said.\u00a0 ADAR is the number of new cases in a city or province over a two-week period, divided by the population of the city or province. RELATED VIDEO: 12 NCR cities included in 15 LGUs with high daily cases Quezon City topped the areas in the country that recorded new COVID-19 cases in the past week, averaging with 274 confirmed infections daily.\u00a0 The group added that aside from QC, 11 other cities in Metro Manila were included in the top 15 areas that logged a high number of newly-reported infections between Mar. 5 to Mar. 11.\u00a0 Local chief executives in the Metro on Thursday night agreed to reintroduce a two-week curfew hours starting on Monday, March 15, in a bid to contain the virus.\u00a0 Researchers however belief the curfew is not enough.\u00a0 The local government should now also intervene to prevent inundating hospitals, and \"put an end to this surge,\" they said.\u00a0 \"Localized lockdowns have been shown to be effective in slowing down increasing trends in new cases. Additional restrictions such as curfews, border controls, reduced capacity in certain establishments, limitations in social gatherings... as well as continued monitoring and strict implementation by the local governments will hopefully slow down the rate of infection in NCR,\" the report read.\u00a0 The country's top health officials earlier denied that the detected presence of COVID-19 variants locally led to the recent spike of infections, and blamed the public becoming more \"lax\" in observing minimum health protocols. But a survey conducted by the same group of researchers showed that a majority of Filipinos complied with wearing face masks and washing of hands when they go out of their homes, but many failed to abide by physical distancing measures.\u00a0 - With a report from Kristine Sabillo, ABS-CBN News"

However, Go said, \"Magbabago lang siguro ang isip ko kung tatakbong Vice President si Pangulong Duterte.\" (My mind might only change is President Duterte will run as vice president.)\u00a0 Duterte campaigned for Go during the 2019 Senate race that saw the defeat of all candidates from the opposition slate Otso Diretso.\u00a0 The Senate neophyte went straight to a national position on his first election bid. While now a lawmaker, he continues to be seen on the President's side in his official events.\u00a0 Go also features prominently on state TV's Laging Handa briefing, the only lawmaker with regular appearances there.\u00a0 Recently, he was the one who made major announcements related to the arrival of COVID-19 vaccines in the country, ahead of confirmations by the vaccine czar himself.\u00a0 The Chief Executive has said in multiple occasions that his daughter Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte-Carpio would not seek to succeed him in the 2022 elections.\u00a0 Duterte said women are not fit to be President.\u00a0 He also said Vice President Leni Robredo can't be Chief Executive, though she has not revealed plans for the 2022 race. Robredo is the leader of the opposition.\u00a0 The President's spokesman Harry Roque, meanwhile, accused Robredo of politicking, an allegation that her spokesman Barry Gutierrez fired back at Duterte's allies.\u00a0"
